# Word-Guess-Game
## This is a classic word guessing game with a crunchy fruits and veggies theme!
### This is mostly JS, for a simply HTML/CSS with bootstrap

* The player is presented with the hidden word as blank underscores _ _ _ _ _
* Using that info, plus the theme, the goal is to start tapping keys to reveal the word.
* For every wrong guess, the "bad guy" creeps on to the page through increasing opacity with JS.
* Alerts interact with the player, notifying them when they have repeated a guess, or hit a non alphabetic character.

**Enjoy!**
